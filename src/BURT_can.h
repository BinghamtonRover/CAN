/// 
/// The CAN protocol allows microcontrollers to efficiently communicate. On the rover, 
/// CAN is used to coordinate the subsystems to the onboard computer. When the computer
/// receives a command from the operator, it translates it to a CAN message with a specific
/// ID. The ID designates the purpose of the message as well as which function is to handle it.
/// 
/// Internally, this service delegates to the [`FlexCAN_T4`](https://github.com/tonton81/FlexCAN_T4) library.
/// 
/// Usage: 
/// - Use #setup to initialize the CAN service
/// - Use #update to check for new messages
/// - Use #send to send some data to a given ID
/// - Use #registerHandler to designate a function to handle messages with a given ID
/// 
/// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus for more details.
